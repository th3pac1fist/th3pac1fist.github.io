THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO HARNESS THE POWER OF AI FOR THE CREATION OF BEDTIME STORIES USING IDEAS SUPPLIED BY MY KIDS AND OTHERS. HOW DID I COME 
UP WITH THIS? 

WELL IT WAS ACTUALLY A SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM I WAS HAVING. MY DAUGHTER WOULD SUPPLY ME WITH IDEAS FOR THE BASE OF A BEDTIME STORY I WOULD TELL HER EVERY 
NIGHT BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP. AN EXAMPLE PLOT SHE WANTED ME TO USE WAS THEMED AROUND A BABY FLAMINGO WHO GETS LOST. THEN I WOULD TAKE THAT PLOT, AND MAKE UP A 
STORY ON THE FLY. THE STORIES WERE TARGETED TO BE AROUND FIVE MINUTES OR LESS. 

AT FIRST IT WAS EASY TO DO THIS. AS TIME WENT ON THOUGH, I NOTICED MY STORIES ALL STARTED TO SOUND THE SAME. MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT AS 
IMPRESSED AS SHE ONCE WAS. THEN CHATGPT CAME ON THE SCENE. I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A SHOT AT GENERATING A SHORT STORY GIVEN A PLOT SHE HAD SUPPLIED ME WITH. 
THE FIRST ONE I GENERATED WAS ABOUT THE BABY FLAMINGO. WHICH ACTUALLY WAS THE VERY FIRST PLOT MY DAUGHTER GAVE ME WHEN I BEGAN MAKING UP BEDTIME STORIES FOR HER.

THE GENERATION OF STORY IDEAS IS COMPLETELY OPEN TO ANYONE! TO KEEP EVERYONE AS ANONYMOUS AS I CAN, I HAVE THE STORY PLOTTERS 
CREATE THEIR OWN UNIQUE ONLINE HANDLE. THAT WAY I CAN GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR THE BASE PLOT OF THE AI GENERATED STORY. YOU CAN SUBMIT YOUR STORY PLOT USING 
THIS FORM [STORY IDEAS](https://th3pac1fist.github.io/#storyideas), ALONG WITH A UNIQUE ONLINE HANDLE. TO STAY ANONYMOUS, DO NOT SUBMIT AN EMAIL ADDRESS. 

EVERYTHING BESIDES THE SUPPLIED STORY PLOTS, ARE GENERATED USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. MY WIFE IS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER. I AM HOPING AT SOME POINT SHE 
WILL FIND A STORY IN THE SITES DIGITAL LIBRARY SHE CAN USE IN ONE OF HER LESSON PLANS. 

IF YOU WANT TO HELP WITH THE PROJECT, JUST LET ME KNOW!
