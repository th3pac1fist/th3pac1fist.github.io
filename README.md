This project uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create unique bedtime stories based on prompts supplied by users, primarily children. The project began when the creator noticed their own stories sounding repetitive, and utilized AI to generate more diverse narratives. Users, identified by their unique handles to maintain anonymity, can submit their story ideas. Each AI-generated story is credited to the user who provided the plot. The stories, all created by AI apart from the initial plot prompts, are stored in a digital library that the creator's wife, a preschool teacher, might use for her lessons. The creator invites anyone interested in contributing to the project to reach out.

Submit story ideas using this form [STORY IDEAS](https://th3pac1fist.github.io/#storyideas), along with a unique online handle. To stay anonymous, do not submit an email address.
