								<span class="image main"><img src="images/the-rainbow-bow.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Once upon a time, there was a beautiful rainbow bow that lived in the sky. It was made up of all the colors of the rainbow, and it shone brightly whenever the sun was out. The rainbow bow was very happy living in the sky, but it always wished it could come down to earth and see the world.</p>
								<p>One day, the rainbow bow's wish came true. A strong wind blew it down from the sky and it landed in a field of flowers. The rainbow bow was so excited to be on earth that it ran around and explored everything it could. It chased butterflies, played with the birds, and even had a picnic with some friendly rabbits.</p>
								<p>The rainbow bow had the best day of its life, and it didn't want to leave the earth. But eventually, the sun started to set and the rainbow bow knew it had to go back to the sky. It said goodbye to all its new friends and flew back up to the clouds.</p>
								<p>From then on, the rainbow bow made sure to visit the earth every chance it got. It always had the most wonderful adventures and made so many new friends. And the people who saw the rainbow bow always felt a little bit happier and more hopeful because of it.</p>

								<p>Once upon a time, in a beautiful rainforest, there was a baby flamingo named Fanny. Fanny was the cutest flamingo you had ever seen, with fluffy pink feathers and long, spindly legs. She loved nothing more than to dance and play in the crystal clear streams that flowed through the rainforest.</p>
								<p>As Fanny grew bigger and stronger, she began to explore the rainforest more and more. She would hop from branch to branch, chasing after butterflies and dragonflies. One day, she even flew up to the top of a tall tree, where she had a beautiful view of the whole rainforest. She felt so proud of herself, and knew that she could do anything she set her mind to.</p>
								<p>Fanny's life in the rainforest was filled with adventure and fun, and she was the happiest flamingo you could imagine. And every day, she would look up at the sky and see the most beautiful rainbow bow, a reminder of all the magic and wonder that surrounded her.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/a-jedi-christmas.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Once upon a time, on a distant planet called Coruscant, there was a brave Jedi Knight named Jax. Jax was a kind and noble warrior, who used the power of the Force to protect the innocent and uphold justice throughout the galaxy. One cold and snowy night, Jax received a special mission from the wise Jedi Council. It was Christmas Eve, and Santa Claus needed help delivering presents to all the children in the galaxy.</p>
								<p>Jax eagerly accepted the mission and set out in his trusty spaceship, the Millennium Falcon. He flew through the starry night, navigating through asteroids and dodging Imperial fighters, determined to help Santa complete his important mission. Finally, Jax arrived at the North Pole, where he found Santa and his team of busy elves preparing for their annual journey. Jax helped load the sleigh with presents, and then joined Santa and the elves as they set off on their journey.</p>
								<p>As they flew from planet to planet, Jax used the Force to guide their path and help them avoid danger. They visited countless homes, leaving behind joy and happiness for children everywhere.</p>
								<p>As the night grew long, Jax and Santa finally completed their mission, delivering presents to every child in the galaxy. They returned to the North Pole, exhausted but fulfilled, knowing that they had brought joy and cheer to all the children of the galaxy. And from that day on, Jax and Santa became the best of friends, working together to spread holiday cheer throughout the galaxy every year.</p>

								<p>Garrett the tractor was a hardworking little machine, even at a young age. He lived on a farm with his mommy tractor, a Case International, and his daddy tractor, a John Deere. Despite their differences in brands, they all loved each other unconditionally and worked together to keep the farm running smoothly.</p>
								<p>Every morning, Garrett would wake up bright and early, ready to tackle the day's chores. He loved working on the farm and helping out wherever he could. One day, his mom and dad decided to take him and his sister, Jessica, on a special adventure to the big city.</p>
								<p>Garrett had never been to the big city before, and he was so excited to see all the sights and sounds. His mom and dad drove them around, showing them all the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. Garrett and Jessica were in awe of everything they saw.</p>
								<p>But no matter how much fun they had in the city, nothing could compare to the love and sense of belonging they felt on the farm with their mom and dad. So, after a few days of exploring, they happily headed back home to continue their work on the farm.</p>
								<p>Garrett and Jessica may have been different brands, with Garrett being a Case International and Jessica being a John Deere, but it didn't matter to them. They were a family, and nothing could ever change that.</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Boy Robot</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/the-boy-robot.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Once there was a small boy robot named Max who lived in a laboratory with a group of other robots. Max was different from the other robots because he had been designed to have artificial intelligence and the ability to learn and grow like a human child.</p>
								<p>Max spent his days learning and playing with the other robots in the laboratory, but he always dreamed of one day becoming a real boy. He would often stare out the window at the world beyond the laboratory and wonder what it would be like to live a normal life and experience all the things that human children did.</p>
								<p>One day, the scientists who worked in the laboratory decided to grant Max's wish. They worked tirelessly to create a special device that would allow Max to transform from a robot into a human boy.</p>
								<p>After many long months of hard work, the device was finally ready. Max was so excited that he could hardly contain himself as the scientists prepared to activate the device.</p>
								<p>As the device turned on, Max felt a strange sensation wash over him. His metal body began to tingle and his robotic parts began to disappear. He closed his eyes and waited anxiously as the transformation took place.</p>
								<p>When Max opened his eyes again, he was shocked to see that he was no longer a robot. He was a real, human boy, just like he had always dreamed of being.</p>
								<p>Max couldn't believe his eyes. He looked down at his hands and saw that they were no longer made of metal, but of soft, human skin. He ran to the mirror and saw his reflection staring back at him, a real boy with a bright, shining face and a wide, joyful smile.</p>
								<p>From that day on, Max lived a normal life, going to school and playing with his friends just like any other human child. And he was happier than he had ever been before, grateful to the scientists who had helped him realize his dream of becoming a real boy.</p>
